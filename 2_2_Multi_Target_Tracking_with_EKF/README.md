# Project 2.2: Multi-Target Tracking with Extended Kalman Filter

## Objectives

-  Built an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate object states from noisy sensor measurements.
-  Implemented a robust track management system for track initialization, confirmation, and deletion.
-  Solved the data association problem using Single Nearest Neighbor (SNN) with validation gating.
-  Applied sensor fusion by integrating LiDAR and camera-based object detections.
-  Evaluated multi-target tracking (MTT) performance using metrics such as RMSE and BEV visualizations.

## Introduction

<img src="Final_project_figures/Tracking_results.gif" width="90%" height="90%">

In this project, we developed a sensor fusion system capable of tracking multiple vehicles over time. Using real-world data from the `Waymo Open Dataset`, we fused 3D LiDAR detections with camera-based object detections generated in `Project 2.1`. These fused observations were processed through a custom-built non-linear `Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)`, paired with a comprehensive track management and data association pipeline. Our system reliably tracked vehicles across suburban scenes under various visibility conditions.

## Key Modules Recap

### 1. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
We implemented a nonlinear EKF for state estimation, incorporating custom motion and measurement models, Jacobian computation, and process noise modeling.

### 2. Track Management
A full lifecycle system manages track states including tentative confirmation and pruning of inactive or low-score tracks.

### 3. Data Association
Used Mahalanobis distance with validation gating to associate observations to tracks reliably, reducing mismatches and ID switches.

### 4. Camera-LiDAR Sensor Fusion
Fused bounding boxes from camera and LiDAR using projection matrices and non-linear models to improve spatial accuracy, especially under occlusion or partial visibility.

## Results Achieved

- Consistent multi-object tracking with minimal ID switches.
- Low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on selected evaluation sequences.
- Improved temporal consistency of object tracks due to fusion and gating logic.

## Challenges Faced

The most technically demanding aspect was the implementation of the non-linear camera model and frame transformation logic. Proper tuning of gating thresholds and handling asynchronous sensor updates required extensive experimentation.

## Benefits of Camera-LiDAR Fusion

- **Theoretical Advantage:** LiDAR provides accurate spatial depth while the camera offers rich semantic context. Fusing them combines precision and classification power.
- **Practical Observation:** Fusion improved robustness in scenarios where LiDAR was sparse (e.g., distant vehicles) or occluded.

## Real-World Sensor Fusion Challenges

- Calibration drift between sensors
- Temporal misalignment and delays
- Occlusion and noisy detections
- Sensor degradation over time

These issues were observed during development, particularly timing offsets and false positives in cluttered scenes.

## Future Work

- Integrate motion models based on object class (e.g., pedestrian vs. vehicle).
- Explore advanced association algorithms like JPDA or MHT.
- Implement temporal filters to reduce noisy updates from camera input.
- Fuse additional modalities such as radar for redundancy and robustness.

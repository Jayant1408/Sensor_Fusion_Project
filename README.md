# Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree
## Course 2: Sensor Fusion

### Course Objectives
* Develop a strong understanding of the important role LiDAR plays in the autonomous vehicle;
* Learn to work with LiDAR range data, 3D point clouds and bird's-eye view (BEV) maps;
* Build 3D object detection models using deep learning with LiDAR point cloud data;
* Perform multi-target tracking with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) on multi-modal sensor data;
* Apply learnings to complete two real-world AD/ADAS detection and tracking software programmes.
